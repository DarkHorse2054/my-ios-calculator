## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

You only need a modern web browser to view and use this calculator.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository (if hosted on GitHub):**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/iOS-Calculator.git](https://github.com/your-username/iOS-Calculator.git)
    ```
    (Replace `your-username` with your GitHub username and `iOS-Calculator.git` with your repository name.)

    **OR, if you downloaded the files directly:**
    Ensure you have the following three files in the same folder:
    * `index.html`
    * `style.css`

## üì± Testing on iPhone

You can easily test this calculator on your iPhone using a local server or by hosting it online.

### Option 1: Local Server (Requires iPhone and Mac on the Same Wi-Fi)

1.  **Open Terminal** on your Mac.
2.  **Navigate to your project folder**:
    ```bash
    cd /path/to/your/iOS_Calculator_Folder
    ```
    (You can also type `cd ` and drag your folder into the Terminal window.)
3.  **Start a simple HTTP server**:
    ```bash
    python3 -m http.server
    ```
    This will typically serve the content on `port 8000`.
4.  **Find your Mac's local IP address**:
    * In a new Terminal window: `ipconfig getifaddr en0` (for Wi-Fi)
    * Or via System Settings > Network > Wi-Fi > Details.
5.  **On your iPhone**, open Safari and enter your Mac's IP address followed by `:8000` (e.g., `http://192.168.1.100:8000`).

### Option 2: Host Online (Accessible Anywhere)

For a more permanent and accessible solution, consider using free hosting services for static websites:

* **GitHub Pages:** Upload your files to a public GitHub repository, then enable GitHub Pages in your repository settings.
* **Netlify Drop:** Drag and drop your project folder onto [app.netlify.com/drop](https://app.netlify.com/drop) for instant deployment.
* **Vercel:** Similar to Netlify, Vercel offers quick deployments directly from your project folder or Git repository.
